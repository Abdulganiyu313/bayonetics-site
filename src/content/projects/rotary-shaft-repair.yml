title: Rotary Shaft Repair & Alignment
client: Quarry Conveyor Line
location: Ogun, Nigeria

summary: Precision machining and alignment of a worn conveyor drive shaft to restore concentricity and reduce vibration.
services: [maintenance-repair, precision-machining]
outcomes:
  - Concentricity restored to within 0.02 mm TIR
  - Bearing temperature dropped by 18Â°C after run-in
  - Vibration at the coupling reduced to acceptable ISO range
  - Returned to service within 24 hours
notes:
  - The quarry's main conveyor drive shaft had developed significant runout due to wear and misalignment, leading to excessive vibration and bearing temperatures. Our team performed on-site precision machining to restore the shaft's concentricity, rebuilt the bearing seats, and executed a meticulous alignment procedure using laser alignment tools. Post-repair monitoring showed a substantial reduction in vibration levels and bearing temperatures, ensuring reliable operation of the conveyor system.
  - The successful completion of this project not only minimized downtime but also enhanced the overall efficiency of the conveyor system, demonstrating our commitment to delivering high-quality engineering solutions.
  - Our team's expertise in precision machining and alignment was crucial in addressing the complex challenges presented by this project.
  - Our commitment to quality and attention to detail ensured a successful outcome.
