services: [precision-machining, custom-parts]
outcomes:
  - Hub and sprocket assembly delivered as a complete unit
  - Bore keyed with set screws, lightly balanced for smoother rotation
  - Finished with rust-preventive oil to ensure protection in service
  - Dimensions verified before shipment; client requested extra units for future use

notes:
  - We manufactured a custom sprocket with a machined hub and keyway for a conveyor system at a soybean processing plant. The sprocket was designed to match the specific chain pitch used in the client's equipment, ensuring optimal performance and longevity. Our precision machining capabilities allowed us to create a keyed bore with set screws for secure attachment to the shaft, while also lightly balancing the assembly to minimize vibration during operation. The finished sprocket was coated with a rust-preventive oil to protect against corrosion in the plant environment.
  - The project was completed on schedule, with the sprocket assemblies delivered as complete units ready for installation. The client appreciated the attention to detail and the quality of the machining, which contributed to the reliable operation of their conveyor system.
  - Our team's expertise in precision machining and custom part fabrication was instrumental in meeting the client's specific requirements and ensuring a successful outcome.
