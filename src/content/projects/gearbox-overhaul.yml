title: Gearbox Overhaul & Bearing Replacement
client: Planet Bottling Company
location: Ogun, Nigeria
date: 2025-04-03
summary: Stripped and rebuilt a reduction gearbox with new bearings and shaft refurbishment.
services: [maintenance-repair, precision-machining]
outcomes:
  - Gearbox stripped, cleaned, and inspected for wear
  - Worn bearings replaced with new parts
  - Shaft journals machined to restore surface finish
  - Reassembled and tested to ensure proper operation
notes:
  - We performed a comprehensive overhaul of a reduction gearbox used in a bottling plant. The gearbox was stripped down to its components, which were then cleaned and inspected for wear and damage. Worn bearings were replaced with new, high-quality parts to ensure reliable operation. The shaft journals were machined to restore their surface finish, improving the fit and function of the bearings. After reassembly, the gearbox was tested to verify proper operation and performance.
  - The project was completed on schedule, minimizing downtime for the client. The refurbished gearbox is expected to provide reliable service for years to come, thanks to the thorough inspection and replacement of critical components.
  - Our team's expertise in gearbox maintenance and precision machining was crucial in achieving a successful outcome for this project.
