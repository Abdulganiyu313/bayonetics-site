services: [welding-fabrication, custom-parts, material-sourcing]

outcomes:
  - Custom 304 stainless steel hopper fabricated to spec
  - TIG-welded joints for strength and hygiene
  - Brushed finish for easy cleaning and contamination prevention
  - Installed on-site with verified clearances for tool-less removal

notes:
  - We fabricated a custom stainless steel hopper for an apple and pears processing line, ensuring compliance with hygiene standards. The hopper was TIG-welded for strength and durability, then finished with a brushed surface to prevent contamination and facilitate cleaning. Our team worked closely with the client to ensure the design met their specific requirements for tool-less access during maintenance, enhancing operational efficiency.
  - The project was completed on schedule, with the fabricated hopper delivered and installed on site, resulting in improved safety and functionality of the processing line.
  - Our expertise in stainless steel fabrication and attention to detail ensured a high-quality outcome that met the client's expectations.
