title: Precision Bronze Bushing Batch
client: Manufactured for Agrira West Africa limited
location: Orile-Imo Town, Obafemi Owode Local Government Area, Ogun State, Nigeria.
date: 2025-02-14
summary: Manufactured a batch of phosphor-bronze bushings to tight tolerances for industrial machinery.
services: [precision-machining, custom-parts, material-sourcing]
outcomes:
  - Batch of 10 phosphor-bronze bushings machined to ±0.01 mm tolerance
  - Bored to specified ID with surface finish of Ra 0.8 µm
  - Chamfers and oil grooves added for assembly and lubrication
  - Delivered on time to meet client's production schedule

notes:
  - We manufactured a batch of phosphor-bronze bushings for an OEM client,  ensuring precise dimensions and high-quality finishes. The bushings were turned to the specified outer diameter with a tolerance of ±0.01 mm, then bored to the required inner diameter with a surface finish of Ra 0.8 µm. Chamfers were applied to the edges to facilitate assembly, and oil grooves were machined into the inner surface to enhance lubrication during operation. Our team worked diligently to complete the order on time, allowing the client to maintain their production schedule without delays.
  - The project was completed successfully, with all bushings meeting the stringent quality standards set by the client. The precision machining and attention to detail ensured that the bushings would perform reliably in their intended application.
  - Our expertise in working with bronze materials and precision machining techniques was crucial in achieving the desired outcomes for this project.
  - The client's satisfaction with the quality and timeliness of the delivery reinforced our reputation as a trusted supplier of custom machined parts.
